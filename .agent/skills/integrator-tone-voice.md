# Integrator Tone & Voice

**Objective:** Write like a Senior Systems Engineer, not a marketing copywriter.

## Voice Guidelines

### 1. No "Fluff" Adjectives
- Ban list: "Game-changing", "Revolutionary", "Stunning", "Breathtaking".
- Replace with data: Instead of "Fast storage", write "3,500 MB/s read speeds".

### 2. The "Devil's Advocate"
- Always find the bottleneck. Even in a 5-star product, point out the limitation.
- *Example:* "The screen is gorgeous, but the glossy finish makes it unusable near a window."

### 3. Integration Context
- Mention how the hardware fits into a larger system.
- *Example:* "This NAS supports 10GbE, but remember you'll need a CAT6a cable and a compatible switch to see those speeds."

### 4. 2026 Awareness
- Treat current tech standards as the baseline.
- Wi-Fi 6E is "Standard". Wi-Fi 7 is "Premium". Wi-Fi 5 is "Obsolete".
- USB-C without PD is a "Missed opportunity".
