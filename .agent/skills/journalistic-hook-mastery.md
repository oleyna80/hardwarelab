# Journalistic Hook Mastery

**Objective:** Create engaging introductions that force the user to read past the first fold.

## Strategies

### 1. The "Problem/Solution" Hook
Start with a pain point relevant to the specific persona.
- *Bad:* "The Beelink SER5 is a mini PC with Ryzen 5800H."
- *Good:* "For years, budget homelabs faced a choice: buy loud, power-hungry used servers or weak Raspberry Pis. The Beelink SER5 changes the math."

### 2. The "Contrarian" Hook
Challenge a popular belief.
- *Bad:* "The RTX 4060 is a good card."
- *Good:* "Everyone says 8GB VRAM is dead in 2026. The RTX 4060 is here to prove them wrong—if you play at 1080p."

### 3. The "Identity" Hook
Call out the user directly.
- *Good:* "If you are a Docker enthusiast running out of RAM on your laptop, stop scrolling. This review is for you."

## Constraint
Every review introduction MUST use one of these strategies. Never start with a dry spec list.
