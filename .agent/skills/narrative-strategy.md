# Narrative Strategy

This skill helps define the "Marketing Angle", "Target Persona", and "Hook" for hardware reviews. It transforms dry specs into a compelling narrative constraint.

## Usage
Use this skill when performing the **Tech Audit** (`tech-auditor.md`) to fill the "The Angle" section.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Target Persona
Who is this product ACTUALLY for? Be specific.
- **Bad:** "Gamers"
- **Good:** "Competitive FPS players who sacrifice resolution for refresh rate (360Hz+)"

### 2. The Hook
One sentence that sells the review (not just the product).
- **Example:** "The only OLED monitor that doesn't burn in, but costs as much as a used car."
- **Example:** "A budget mainboard that beats flagships in VRM thermals."

### 3. Mandatory Cons
What must be mentioned to keep us honest?
- "No USB-C"
- "Dim HDR"
- "Wobbly stand"

## Checklist for Strategy
- [ ] Is the persona distinct?
- [ ] Is the hook controversial or surprising?
- [ ] Are the cons significant enough to matter?
