# SEO Content Structure

**Objective:** Structure the review to capture Google Snippets and satisfy user intent.

## Rules

### 1. The "At a Glance" Summary
- Must be the first section after the Hero.
- Must answer: "Who is this for?" and "What is the key feature?" in the first paragraph.
- Keywords: Use the product full name in the first 100 words.

### 2. H2 Question Headers
- Prefer phrasing headers as questions users type into Google.
- *Bad:* "Performance Section"
- *Good:* "Can the Ryzen 5800H handle Plex transcoding?"
- *Good:* "Is 8GB RAM enough for Windows 11 in 2026?"

### 3. The "Verdict" Snippet
- The Verdict must summarize the Pros/Cons in a way that can be featured.
- Bold the primary recommendation: **"Buy this if..."** / **"Skip this if..."**

### 4. Internal Linking Strategy
- Always link to related reviews contextually within the body text, not just at the end.
- Use descriptive anchor text (e.g., "compared to the [Mac mini M4](/reviews/mac-mini-m4)...").
