# Skill: Subagent Mission Brief

## Purpose

Use this skill when Control Tower delegates non-trivial work to a subagent and
needs a concise operational assignment instead of a broad prompt.

The brief defines authority, focus, scope, tools, stop conditions, expected
output, and handoff target. It does not create a new workflow stage.

## When to Use

- Architecture, security, backend, frontend, QA, docs, or product analysis
- Large file inspection or broad review
- Independent verifier or reviewer gates
- Scoped implementation with an approved write-set
- Tasks where output is large enough to keep out of the main chat
- Any temporary mission role that needs clear boundaries

## When to Skip

- Trivial local tasks where delegation adds overhead
- One-line checks or simple status commands
- Discussion-only turns
- Tasks already covered by a precise Work Block and no subagent is needed

## Mission Brief Structure

Use this compact structure:

Template: `docs/templates/subagent-mission-brief-template.md`

## Prompting Rules

- Be specific and direct.
- Separate context from instructions.
- Define the output format.
- Give only necessary context.
- Do not ask the model to reveal chain-of-thought.
- Do not overload subagents with unrelated files.
- Give one clear responsibility per subagent.
- Limit tool access to what the task needs.
- Treat subagent completion as evidence, not acceptance.
- Tell the subagent to report only from its assigned base role and mission role.
- Tell the subagent not to infer orchestration mechanics. If asked whether it
  ran through native subagent tooling, fallback, fork, or inline execution, it
  must answer `not assessed` unless Control Tower explicitly provided that fact.
- For DB, deploy, infra, secret, or client-facing tasks, state the
  side-effect class and DB action mode from `AGENTS.md`.
- Inherit model/reasoning by default unless a task-specific override is needed;
  record the reason if you request an override.
- Prefer official or primary sources for external research.
- If a tool, MCP, or external source is unavailable, continue with local
  analysis and report the limitation.

## Temporary Mission Roles

Base role controls authority: Orchestrator, Coder, Reviewer, or Verifier.
Mission role controls focus: Architecture Analyst, Tech Lead, Security Analyst,
Backend Coder, QA Analyst, Docs Analyst, Release Ops, or another task-specific
specialization.

Temporary mission roles do not expand file authority. A `Reviewer / Security
Analyst` remains read-only. A `Coder / Backend Coder` may write only inside the
approved write-set.

## Allowed Tools / MCP

List only tools the subagent needs. Examples:

- Repository reads: `rg`, `sed`, `git diff`, `git status`
- Verification: project check commands from the Work Block
- External docs: official vendor docs, primary GitHub repos/issues/releases
- MCP: only when available and useful for the mission

Tool capability does not grant process authority. Production APIs, credentials,
deploys, live DB migrations, destructive git operations, and real client
communications still require Owner approval.

## Side-Effect and DB Boundaries

Use `AGENTS.md` as the canonical authority source. For any mission touching DB,
infra, deploy, secrets, or real client communications, include:

- `Side-effect class`: one class from `AGENTS.md § Side-Effect Classes`.
- `DB action mode`: one mode from `AGENTS.md § DB Access Matrix`, or `none`.

If the required class or DB mode is unclear, the subagent must stop and report
the ambiguity instead of assuming permission.

## Parallel Context

For non-trivial Work Blocks, link each mission brief to the Stage 0 Parallel
Decomposition Matrix:

- `Parallel group`: e.g. `Gate B review`, `Docs cleanup`, `Backend slice`.
- `Sibling streams`: other agents or local streams running at the same time.
- `Dependencies`: what must finish before this result can be accepted.

If the task is intentionally local or sequential, state why: write conflict,
dependency chain, shared runtime, hard-stop boundary, uncertain scope, or no
delegation value.

## Approved Write-Set

For read-only missions, write:

`Approved write-set: none. Read-only.`

For implementation, list exact paths or path patterns. Use one write-capable
Coder per write-set. Do not delegate broad repo write access.

## Stop Conditions

Tell the subagent to stop and report if:

- Scope expansion is required.
- A hard stop from `AGENTS.md` is reached.
- Required files or tools are unavailable.
- Verification fails in a way that affects acceptance.
- Secrets, credentials, or risky production config are encountered.
- Unrelated dirty files block the task.

## Expected Output

Ask for a compact result that Control Tower can act on:

- Verdict
- Files inspected or changed
- Findings or implementation summary
- Checks run and result
- Verification evidence
- Risks / blockers
- Recommended next action

For reviewers, findings come first and are ordered by severity.

## Acceptance Boundary

A subagent result is not accepted just because the subagent returned `DONE`.
Control Tower accepts the result only after checking:

- scope and write-set compliance
- acceptance criteria coverage
- required evidence/checks
- declared risks and deferred work

Verifier results use the verdict language from `sdd-protocol.md`.

## Subagent Self-Report Boundary

Subagents report their assigned mission only. They must not:

- present themselves as Control Tower unless assigned that base role;
- judge whether orchestration used native `spawn_agent`, fallback, or another
  runtime path;
- infer, speculate about, or self-certify native/fallback execution mode. If
  this appears in the expected output, write `not assessed` unless Control
  Tower explicitly provided the orchestration fact;
- evaluate platform/tool availability outside their mission;
- launch nested external AI CLI tools such as `codex`, `claude`, Gemini,
  DeepSeek, Qwen, or similar reviewers unless explicitly assigned as an
  `External Audit Runner`;
- accept their own output as final project acceptance.

Control Tower owns orchestration mechanics, acceptance, and final consolidation.

## Codex and Claude Code

Use the same mission brief shape for Codex, Claude Code, or a manual fallback
prompt. Runtime mechanics may differ, but the contract stays the same:
authority comes from base role, focus comes from mission role, and hard stops
remain Owner-gated.

## Handoff

- **Success condition**: Control Tower can merge the subagent result into the
  current SDD stage without asking follow-up questions.
- **Next**: Control Tower consolidates results and proceeds through the active
  Work Block.
- **Auto-proceed**: 🟢 YES inside approved scope.
- **Hard stop**: 🔴 YES for `AGENTS.md` hard stops or unavailable required
  authority.
