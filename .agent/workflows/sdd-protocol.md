# SDLC Protocol — Runtime-Neutral Stage Contract

> Canonical generated-project lifecycle. It defines management functions,
> evidence, gates, and state transitions independently of the agent runtime.

## Core Principle

The lifecycle requires functions and artifacts, not a fixed number of agents.
One capable runtime may execute several functions for low-risk work. Higher-risk
work requires stronger independence as recorded in the active Work Block.

```text
Stage 0 — Define
Stage 1 — Execute
Stage 2 — Assure
Stage 3 — Close
```

## State Model

Stage execution state:

```text
blocked -> ready -> in_progress -> completed
   ^                              |
   +------------- retry ----------+
```

Track gates and outcomes separately:

- **Write gate:** `READY | BLOCKED`
- **Critic gate:** `READY | BLOCKED | SKIPPED | DEGRADED`
- **Review gate:** `READY | CHANGES_REQUIRED | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED | SKIPPED`
- **Verification verdict:** `READY | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED`
- **Evaluation verdict:** `READY | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED | NOT_REQUIRED`
- **Drift gate:** `READY | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED | SKIPPED`
- **Closeout mode:** `success-closeout | reporting-only`

Only all required gates in a passing state permit `success-closeout`.
`BLOCKED`, `UNVERIFIED`, or unresolved `CHANGES_REQUIRED` permits diagnostics,
corrective planning, evidence capture, and reporting-only closeout. It does not
permit merge-ready, deploy-ready, release-ready, or completed-task claims.

Evaluation is assurance evidence. It does not grant source-write authority,
integration admission, credentials, deployment permission, or a Hard Stop exception.
Trajectory evaluation uses observable events only and must never request hidden
reasoning, private chain-of-thought, or model scratchpads.

## Governance Profiles

The Work Block selects the smallest sufficient governance profile:

- **Advisory:** read-only analysis; no repository mutation.
- **Controlled:** one bounded executor, explicit scope/write-set, basic review and deterministic checks.
- **Managed:** approved specification and plan, Critic, Reviewer, Verifier, and evaluation for non-deterministic or consequential agent behavior.
- **Assured:** stronger independence, fixed evaluation rubric/benchmark revisions, drift audit, runtime evidence.
- **Distributed:** multiple runtimes/worktrees/teams with explicit handoff, observable-event provenance, and consolidation.

Runtime choice is separate from governance profile.

# Stage 0 — Define

## Owner

Orchestrator. Architect and Critic functions may be delegated.

## Purpose

Convert a request into an approved, bounded, auditable Work Block before source
changes begin.

## Required Inputs

- current Owner instruction;
- repository state and relevant current source;
- applicable governance and runtime adapter documents;
- relevant accepted specifications and architecture decisions;
- current operational context when resuming work.

## Activities

1. **Frame the objective**
   - expected final result;
   - measurable done criteria;
   - in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries.

2. **Resolve source of truth**
   - identify or create the active specification;
   - record specification status and revision;
   - identify accepted architecture decisions;
   - treat plans and tasklists as derived artifacts.

3. **Classify risk and authority**
   - side-effect class;
   - DB/data action mode;
   - Hard Stops;
   - rollback/recovery expectations;
   - required governance profile.

4. **Negotiate runtime capability**
   - active runtime and adapter;
   - subagent/session/worktree support;
   - hooks and sandbox availability;
   - model class and budget posture;
   - actual isolation available;
   - observable-event capability;
   - fallback path for missing capability.

5. **Define execution topology**
   - logical functions required;
   - runtime binding for each function;
   - one Coder per write-set;
   - parallel work only for independent scopes;
   - consolidation owner.

6. **Route skills**
   - checked;
   - matched;
   - used;
   - skipped with reason.

7. **Create the implementation and assurance plans**
   - ordered tasks;
   - explicit write-set;
   - dependencies;
   - review and verification plan;
   - evaluation requirement and approved plan path;
   - drift triggers.

8. **Run Critic function when triggered**
   - challenge scope, assumptions, authority, risk, topology, verification, and evaluation design;
   - record `APPROVE`, `SUPPLEMENT`, or `RECONSIDER`;
   - rerun Define for material gaps.

## Evaluation Triggers

Output or trajectory evaluation is required when any condition applies:

- output is materially non-deterministic;
- an agent selects tools or execution paths autonomously;
- consequential automation depends on process compliance;
- production users depend on agent-generated responses or decisions;
- an approved benchmark, dataset, rubric, or LM judge is part of acceptance;
- Managed, Assured, or Distributed governance requires it by risk classification.

When evaluation is not required, record the reason explicitly. Runtime or model name
alone neither requires nor waives evaluation.

## Exit Conditions

- active specification identified and approved or marked with explicit approval requirement;
- architecture baseline identified;
- Work Block complete;
- write-set approved;
- runtime capability and isolation recorded;
- verification/review/evaluation/drift plan recorded;
- Critic gate resolved when triggered;
- write gate `READY`.

No source changes are allowed while the write gate is `BLOCKED`.

---

# Stage 1 — Execute

## Owner

Coder. Exactly one write-capable Coder per write-set.

## Entry Conditions

- write gate `READY`;
- approved specification and implementation plan;
- explicit write-set;
- side-effect and Hard Stop classification;
- required runtime capability available or an approved degraded fallback recorded;
- approved evaluation plan available when evaluation is required.

## Activities

1. Read the active specification, plan, acceptance criteria, and relevant source.
2. Implement only inside the approved write-set.
3. Preserve existing project patterns unless the specification approves a change.
4. Do not silently change requirements or architecture.
5. When a legitimate requirement change is discovered, stop and return to Define.
6. Run scoped self-checks.
7. Capture required observable tool, gate, check, retry, side-effect, and evidence events.
8. Redact secrets and protected data from operational evidence.
9. Freeze the implementation diff for assurance.
10. Report `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, or `BLOCKED`.

## Exit Conditions

- planned changes implemented or blockers documented;
- no unapproved scope expansion;
- frozen diff or changed-file list available;
- self-check evidence recorded;
- required observable evaluation events attributable to the Work Block;
- implementation result handed to Stage 2.

A failed Execute stage blocks assurance from passing. Stage 2 may still inspect
partial work for diagnostics, but cannot produce a successful verdict.

---

# Stage 2 — Assure

Stage 2 contains four distinct functions:

```text
2A Independent Review
2B Technical Verification
2C Agent Evaluation
2D Specification Drift Audit
```

They may be executed by separate agents or by separate passes of one runtime,
but actual independence and limitations must be recorded.

## 2A — Independent Review

### Purpose

Inspect the frozen diff for engineering quality and risk.

### Reviewer Checks

- defects and regressions;
- incorrect assumptions and edge cases;
- architecture and dependency violations;
- security and privacy risks;
- maintainability and unnecessary complexity;
- missing tests, evaluation evidence, or observability;
- scope expansion;
- unsafe generated boilerplate or prompt-shaped abstractions.

### Verdicts

- `READY`
- `CHANGES_REQUIRED`
- `BLOCKED`
- `UNVERIFIED`

`CHANGES_REQUIRED` returns the Work Block to Execute for correction, followed by
review of the updated frozen diff.

## 2B — Technical Verification

### Purpose

Demonstrate that acceptance criteria and observable contracts hold.

### Evidence Tiers

- **Lite:** changed-file scope, targeted types/lint/build, relevant tests, obvious regressions.
- **Standard:** Lite plus API/schema, positive/negative cases, runtime smoke, errors/logging, security baseline.
- **Full:** Standard plus threat model, security classification, auth/origin guards, migrations/rollback, independent runtime evidence, approved production-like smoke.

### Verdicts

- `READY`
- `BLOCKED`
- `UNVERIFIED`

Unavailable evidence is `UNVERIFIED`, not `READY`.

## 2C — Agent Evaluation

### Purpose

Evaluate the delivered artifact and observable agent trajectory against the
approved evaluation plan.

### Evidence Classes

- deterministic check results;
- output rubric results;
- observable trajectory events and event-source provenance;
- benchmark/dataset and rubric revisions;
- evaluator identity, judge policy, actual runtime, model class, and isolation;
- inspection gaps, blocked checks, and residual risks.

### Rules

- deterministic correctness cannot pass solely through an LM judge;
- trajectory pass requires all blocking required events and no prohibited event;
- missing or inaccessible event sources are `BLOCKED` or `UNVERIFIED`;
- a fluent final response is not trajectory evidence;
- private chain-of-thought and hidden reasoning are never required evidence;
- changing criteria, thresholds, datasets, or judge policy creates a new plan revision.

### Verdicts

- `READY`
- `BLOCKED`
- `UNVERIFIED`

Required evaluation cannot be skipped. Optional evaluation may be `SKIPPED` only
with a recorded reason in the active Work Block.

## 2D — Specification Drift Audit

### Purpose

Compare:

```text
Specification <-> Architecture decisions <-> Plan <-> Code <-> Tests/Evals <-> Documentation
```

Use `spec-drift-audit` and the standard drift report template.

### Required Triggers

- public behavior, route, API, schema, persistence, or runtime contract changed;
- auth, payment, DB, provider, webhook, security, or architecture changed;
- specification changed during implementation;
- behavior was added outside the approved plan;
- evaluation criteria or evidence reveal an undocumented contract;
- 3 or more implementation files changed;
- Assured or Distributed profile.

### Verdicts

- `ALIGNED` -> drift gate `READY`;
- `ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED` -> drift gate `BLOCKED` until corrected and rerun;
- `BLOCKED` -> drift gate `BLOCKED`;
- `UNVERIFIED` -> drift gate `UNVERIFIED`.

A Quick Fix may skip drift audit only when it has no behavior, contract, schema,
security, runtime, architecture, evaluation, or governance impact.

## Isolation Requirements

| Work type | Review / verification / evaluation expectation |
|---|---|
| Controlled, low-risk | separate pass; same-context allowed but recorded |
| Managed, non-sensitive | separate-subagent or separate-session preferred |
| Assured or sensitive | independent-readonly-root or separate-runtime preferred |
| credentials, live data, deploy mutation | OS-isolated where practical and no production credentials for read-only assurance |
| parallel writers | separate-worktree per write-set plus consolidation |

## Stage 2 Exit Conditions

- review gate resolved;
- verification verdict recorded;
- evaluation verdict recorded when required;
- drift gate resolved when triggered;
- findings include evidence and inspection gaps;
- corrections rerun through the applicable assurance functions;
- parallel results consolidated when relevant.

# Stage 3 — Close

## Owner

Orchestrator.

## Activities

1. Determine closeout mode.
2. Synchronize derived artifacts with the approved specification and delivered state.
3. Update task status.
4. Promote durable, reusable engineering knowledge.
5. Record operational results and residual risks.
6. Produce closeout report and Owner summary.

## Source-of-Truth Synchronization Order

1. current Owner instruction or approved change request;
2. approved specification;
3. accepted architecture decisions and external contracts;
4. approved implementation and evaluation plans;
5. tasklist;
6. review, verification, evaluation, drift, and closeout reports;
7. engineering memory;
8. operational memory and logs.

Plans and tasklists never silently override an approved specification.

## Successful Closeout Conditions

- implementation completed inside scope;
- review gate `READY` or valid documented skip;
- verification verdict `READY`;
- required evaluation status/verdict `READY`;
- drift gate `READY` or valid documented skip;
- required Hard Stop actions either not performed or explicitly approved;
- residual risks documented;
- normative and derived artifacts synchronized.

Otherwise use `reporting-only` and keep the task blocked or incomplete.

---

# Quick-Fix Path

A Quick Fix is allowed only when all are true:

- at most 2 implementation files;
- no behavior, route, API, schema, persistence, security, architecture, runtime,
  dependency, evaluation, governance, or public contract impact;
- no Hard Stop;
- rollback is trivial;
- targeted deterministic checks are available.

```text
Scope statement -> Implement -> targeted self-review/checks -> sync -> close
```

The Orchestrator must record why the full lifecycle and evaluation were not required.

---

# Failure and Degraded Modes

- A failed stage blocks downstream success claims.
- Work may continue for diagnostics, corrective planning, evidence capture, or reporting.
- Missing subagent/model/plugin capability does not remove the logical function.
- Use the strongest available fallback and record actual runtime and isolation.
- A degraded review or evaluation cannot upgrade a blocked verification result.
- Missing observable trajectory evidence cannot be described as a pass.
- No agent may grant itself authority because a tool is technically available.
