# Work Block Template

> Fill this before non-trivial repository mutation. The Work Block binds the
> runtime-neutral governance contract to one concrete objective.

## Metadata

- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Owner:** [name/reference]
- **Orchestrator:** [logical role binding]
- **Governance Profile:** [Advisory | Controlled | Managed | Assured | Distributed]
- **Execution Mode:** [conductor | orchestrator | staged approval | read-only review | advisory]
- **Verification Tier:** [lite | standard | full]
- **Evaluation Required:** [yes | no; risk/non-determinism reason]

## Lifecycle State

- **Current Stage:** [Define | Execute | Assure | Close]
- **Stage State:** [blocked | ready | in_progress | completed]
- **Write Gate:** [READY | BLOCKED]
- **Critic Gate:** [PENDING | READY | BLOCKED | SKIPPED | DEGRADED]
- **Review Gate:** [PENDING | READY | CHANGES_REQUIRED | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED | SKIPPED]
- **Verification Verdict:** [PENDING | READY | BLOCKED | UNVERIFIED]

## Objective

[What user or technical outcome must this Work Block produce?]

## Expected Final Result

[Describe the exact recognizable end state, including user-visible behavior,
repository/runtime state, evidence, documentation, and what must remain clean.]

## Done Criteria

- [ ] [Measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Required deterministic, output, and trajectory evidence exists]
- [ ] [Repository/runtime state is clean or documented]

## Normative Baseline

- **Approved Specification:** [path]
- **Specification Status:** [draft | proposed | approved | superseded]
- **Specification Revision:** [commit/hash/version]
- **Accepted Architecture Decisions:** [paths/IDs]
- **External Contracts:** [API/schema/legal/provider/user contract or not applicable]
- **Derived Implementation Plan:** [path]
- **Approved Evaluation Plan:** [not required | docs/evals/<id>/plan.json]
- **Active Tasklist:** [path]

Rule: approved specification and accepted architecture decisions outrank plans,
tasklists, evaluation reports, and operational logs.

## Repository Preflight

- **Git baseline:** [branch/commit/status]
- **Pre-existing dirty files:** [none | list with ownership]
- **Untracked artifacts:** [none | list]
- **Current diff:** [none | summary/reference]
- **Proceed rule:** [why unrelated changes will not be touched]

## Dependency Check

### Must Resolve Before Start

- [Permission, requirement, access, design, environment, or decision]

### May Resolve During Work

- [Non-blocking uncertainty and stop condition]

## Scope

### In Scope

- [Item]

### Out of Scope

- [Item]

## Write-Set

```text
[Approved files/directories]
```

- **One Coder per write-set:** [yes]
- **Parallel writers:** [no | separate worktrees and non-overlapping write-sets]
- **Scope guard:** [git diff/status/path validation]

Lifecycle reports, evaluation evidence, logs, and gate artifacts are counted
separately from implementation files when applying Quick-Fix and trigger thresholds.

## Risk and Authority

- **Side-Effect Class:** [read-only | local-docs | production-code | local-test | public-repo | live-infra | live-data | client-facing | destructive]
- **DB/Data Action Mode:** [none | local_temp | live_readonly | live_migration_apply | runtime_app | emergency_remediation]
- **Sensitive Domains:** [none | auth | payments | DB/schema | webhooks | provider | deploy | security | client communications | other]
- **Output Non-Determinism:** [none | bounded | material; why]
- **Autonomous Tool/Trajectory Risk:** [none | bounded | material; why]
- **Threat Model Required:** [yes | no; reason]
- **Rollback / Recovery:** [procedure]

## Hard Stops in Scope

- [ ] Production deploy or live service restart
- [ ] Live DB migration or live-data mutation
- [ ] Credential/token/secret change
- [ ] Destructive git/filesystem/database operation
- [ ] Commit or push
- [ ] Push to default branch
- [ ] Public release/publication
- [ ] Client/user communication
- [ ] Payment/order/stock/CRM/external consequential mutation
- [ ] Material specification, evaluation-plan, or scope expansion

For each checked item, record approval state and evidence. Evaluation cannot open
or waive a Hard Stop.

## Runtime Capability Snapshot

- **Primary Runtime:** [codex | claude-code | opencode | generic | other]
- **Runtime Adapter:** [path/reference]
- **Runtime Version:** [observed version | unknown]
- **Native Subagents:** [available | unavailable | unknown]
- **Separate Sessions:** [available | unavailable | unknown]
- **Worktrees / Isolated Roots:** [available | unavailable | unknown]
- **Hooks / Tool Guards:** [available | unavailable | unknown]
- **Sandbox / Permission Controls:** [description]
- **Observable Event Sources:** [tool log/gate log/CI/artifacts/none]
- **MCP / Plugin / External Tools:** [available inventory or none]
- **Known Limitations:** [list]
- **Capability Evidence:** [version/config/smoke/reference]

## Integration Profile and Admission

- **Integration Profile:** [none | official plugin | MCP | file handoff | hosted connector | direct runtime CLI | manual handoff]
- **Approved Integration IDs:** [none | stable IDs matching machine Work Block]
- **Admission Records:** [none | paths based on integration-admission-template.md]
- **Logical Functions Served:** [none | Critic/Reviewer/Verifier/Evaluator/etc.]
- **From / To Boundary:** [runtime/service endpoints]
- **Exact Tools / Actions:** [none | list]
- **Authority:** [read-only | approved write-set | reports only | other]
- **Data Sent Externally:** [none | exact content boundary]
- **Secret / Authentication Source:** [none | local runtime/keychain/env name, no values]
- **Network / External Directory Boundary:** [deny/ask/approved endpoints or paths]
- **Timeout / Cancellation / Retry:** [behavior]
- **Disable / Recovery Procedure:** [steps]
- **Integration Smoke Evidence:** [not required for none | path/result]

Rules:

- generated projects default to `none`;
- availability does not imply permission;
- every automated non-`none` integration requires an admission record;
- external runtime CLI IDs and admission paths must also be present in
  `.agent/active-work-block.json`;
- integration access does not expand the bound logical role or write-set.

completion readiness.
