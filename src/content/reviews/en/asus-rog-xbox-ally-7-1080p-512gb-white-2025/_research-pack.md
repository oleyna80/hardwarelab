## 6) User Quotes (EN only, multi-source, source-verbatim, 4–6)
1) Enrique Estrada (Amazon US review) — sentiment: positive
> “I’ve been using the ally for a while now and I’m really impressed. For a handheld gaming PC, it offers great value and feels well worth the price. The performance and screen quality stand out, especially compared to other devices in this category.”

2) jillian (Amazon CA review) — sentiment: positive
> “I bought this after researching the device for a while, and as far as it goes, it is FANTASTIC. I had to downsize from a mid-tier pc to a handheld, so setting this up wasn't an issue (nor is tweaking a problem for me either). As an avid Xbox fan since the originals release, I was quite excited for this.”

3) Shane (Amazon CA review) — sentiment: positive
> “Got it a day late which is whatever but the actual device was pretty good. Plays both Xbox and Steam games and it's super easy to switch between them also can setup Discord on it as well, not to mention you can install Ubisoft, EA and Epics store. Did a full gaming day on max settings playing some decently intensive games performance wise and handled it perfectly outside of a little bit of lag.”

4) Jeremy (Amazon CA review) — sentiment: positive
> “This is my first major gaming handheld and so far it’s a very nice unit. So far all my Xbox/pc/steam games I have installed have worked flawlessly. The Xbox inspired grips are very ergonomic and comfortable to hold.”

5) JaiD (Amazon CA review) — sentiment: negative
> “I was excited to get this, but I have really struggled with how underpowered it is. Launching games from Steam and Xbox takes forever and the controls that we usually have with windows seem to be absent, like multiple windows. I’ve also had a lot of random errors, like games not launching without reason (for example Hogwarts legacy just says, can’t connect to the Internet but I have Internet.) or the login pin failing when it was correct.”

6) Matthew crane (Amazon CA review) — sentiment: negative
> “This is a horrible product! Mediatek wifi really on a 700$ product that runs more like a 300$ product… wifi cuts out 95% of the time and system response is slower than an sata ssd and armoury crate is a horrible software bloated and slow.. on linux the device is blazing fast but windows it sucks!”

## Translation Quotes (optional, DE — do not use in EN)
1) Petra Hauser (Amazon DE review) — sentiment: negative
> “ich Spiele ein einzieges Spiel auf der X Box.
> Deshalb hab ich mir die Rog XBOX Ally gekauft.
> Ich kann aber mein Spiel nicht Spielen.”
- sourceURL: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/customer-reviews/R2KIETIRMHIMSK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8

2) PeerHB (Amazon DE review) — sentiment: neutral
> “Bin mit dem Gerät zufrieden, aber es ist kein richtiger Xbox-Handheld (also keine Konsole), sondern ein mobiler PC, daher ist der Name schon etwas irreführend. Wenn man bestimmte Spiele auf der Xbox (zu Hause) und auf dem Rog Xbox Ally (unterwegs) spielen möchte, muss man diese für beide Plattformen (Xbox und PC) kaufen. Das ist wirklich nicht gut gelöst.”

3) Ines Widdermann (Amazon DE review) — sentiment: neutral
> “Aufpassen, es können nicht alle Spiele die es auf XBOX gibt auch auf der neuen Handheld gespielt werden. In Zukunft werden wohl alle Anbieter eines Spieles auch eine Handheld Version rausbringen aber bis dahin muss darauf geachtet werden, dass dieses Spiel auf PC oder auf Anywhere gespielt werden kann.”

## Press / Expert Notes (verbatim; not user quotes)
1) Reece Bithrey (Trusted Reviews)
> “Apart from colour, the first difference between the ROG Xbox Ally and the beefier Ally X model is revealed in its port selection. There are two USB-C ports across the top, but the ones on this base model are of a lower spec than the USB4 ports on the X. These ports feature two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports with DisplayPort 2.1 and PD 3.0 capabilities. You also get a headphone jack and a UHS-II Micro SD card reader.”

2) Jason England (Tom’s Guide)
> “For what it’s worth, the ROG Xbox Ally is fine, but at $600, it’s a huge investment for dated performance. The gamer-centric Windows 11 is clean, the design is really comfortable for long play sessions, and the Ryzen Z2A is good enough for indie gaming. But for what you actually get, there are better, cheaper options than this.”

3) Matt Kamen (WIRED)
> “The Redmond giant isn’t diving in solo, though—rather than its own dedicated device, Microsoft has partnered with Asus to deliver two distinct units, the entry-grade ROG Xbox Ally at $600, and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X at a somewhat staggering $1,000. These aren’t so much Xbox handhelds as Xbox- branded handhelds, though, adding recognizable iconography onto what might otherwise be the next generation of Asus’ own portables. The team-up delivers top-tier portable play—but a frequently confusing experience.”
