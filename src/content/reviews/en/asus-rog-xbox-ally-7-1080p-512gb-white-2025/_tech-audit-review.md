## CRITICAL

* **Current:** User Quotes (US/EN) count: 1
* **Proposed:** Add 3–5 US/EN User Quotes (Amazon/Best Buy/Reddit).
* **Why:** The Research Pack still contains only 1 verified US/EN user quote. PASS B requires 4–6 quotes total for the `UserFeedback` section. The update clarified the *structure* (separating User vs. Press) but did not provide the missing *content*.
* **Confidence:** High
* **Needs source:** Community/Retailer reviews (US).

## SUSPICIOUS / NEEDS VERIFICATION

*None. Previous items (SSD Gen 4, DP 2.1) were marked "Keep as Spec" by Researcher instruction and are now accepted as per the official ASUS source provided.*

## OK

* **SSD:** 512GB PCIe 3.0 NVMe (Accepted per Researcher/ASUS Spec).
* **Ports:** USB-C w/ Generic DP/PD (Accepted per Researcher/ASUS Spec).
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen Z2 A (Zen 2, 4C/8T) — *Verified.*
* **RAM:** 16GB LPDDR5-6400 — *Matches provided spec.*
* **Display:** 1080p 120Hz Touch — *Verified.*
* **Formatting:** User Quotes and Press/Expert Notes are now correctly separated in the structure plan.

## Questions for Researcher

1. **RAM Nuance:** The spec lists "LPDDR5" at 6400MT/s. While valid, the Z2 platform often utilizes **LPDDR5X**. Can you confirm if the ASUS packaging explicitly says "5" or "5X"? (If strictly "5", no action needed; just a technical curiosity as "X" is more power efficient).
2. **Quote Sourcing:** Do you have the raw text for the missing 3-5 user quotes ready to drop in, or do you need me to help source them from the US Amazon ASIN provided?
