    *   quote: "I see a lot of people on reddit recommending old Dell/Lenovo/HP USFF computers for budget desktop machines. Those certainly have their place, but with this deal, for about $100 more, you get a more efficient and powerful processor, more RAM and an NVMe SSD. If you don't plan to game, this is a great option."

    *   quote: "Should be perfect for your needs. This is the budget version of the older/original/more powerful 5800H SER5 from a few years back. The 5500U is a reissued 4600U using even older Zen 2 architecture compared to the 5600/5800 Zen 3."

    *   quote: "From my personal experience, the only Beelink SER5 mPCs with USB Type-C ports not supporting 10Gbps were dead or defective. While there are some exceptions to the 10Gbps Type-C standard, if a device supports USB 3.2 Gen2 from its Type-A ports, Type-C supports 10Gbps or even 20Gbps."
