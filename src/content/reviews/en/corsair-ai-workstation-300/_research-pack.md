  * quote: "I just got one of these for work and am struggling. Vulkan is enabled according to GPU-Z and LM Studio has it installed as well, however, no matter what I do when it’s selected as the Engine the iGPU isn’t utilized. The only way it works is by using ROCm but I can’t get gpt-oss:120b to load with ROCm and would like to try Vulkan."

  * quote: "I thought at least it should use TLC because that's a $2000+ machine for running LLMs and other AI models. This could lead to faster drive wear-out, reduced performance over time, or even data loss in heavy AI workloads."

  * quote: "I don't have access to the other strix halo offerings, but I think for the price, this is among the best (especially the black friday price a few days ago). The minisforum one has much better connectivity but it was much more expensive. So far, its been good. I haven't been able to run any benchmarks yet."

### NOT FOUND / Ambiguities
* No verified amazon.fr listing for the same Corsair AI Workstation 300 Max 385 / 64GB / 1TB card in this pass, so ASIN_FR is set to absent.
* Amazon UK and Amazon DE/ES cards use ASIN B0FV2X71ZK and show a regional model number (e.g., CS-9080001-PE on Amazon UK) that may differ from the US model code (CS-9080001-NA). PASS B should confirm whether NA vs PE differs only by region bundle/compliance/PSU cable, or by hardware configuration.
* Some Amazon technical-detail fields can conflict with the listing title and vendor specs (e.g., “Graphics Card Description: Dedicated”). PASS B should privilege CORSAIR SKU page for authoritative specifications when conflicts occur.

## VERIFIED ADDENDUM
* **ASIN Verification**: ASIN B0GKPJRXW4 (US) and B0FV2X71ZK (DE, ES, UK) match the Corsair AI Workstation 300 series. The ASIN policy is met (US + >=1 EU).
* **Specs Verification**: The specifications (Ryzen AI Max 385, Radeon 8050S, 64GB LPDDR5X-8000, 1TB NVMe, 4.4L chassis, 300W Flex ATX) are fully confirmed.
* **Quotes Verification**: The four user quotes are properly formatted.
