# Editor Report: dell-alienware-aw3225qf

## Summary
- Performed light post-copywriter cleanup to improve strictness and consistency, without changing product facts.

## Changes applied
- Replaced the HDR paragraph’s inline quote with an exact verbatim excerpt from the existing UserFeedback quote (no ellipsis/paraphrase).
- Adjusted one `Related Reviews` link text to match the exact title formatting from `prompts/existing-reviews-hardwarelab.md` (`39\"` escaping).

## Needs verification
- None.

## Notes for QA
- Confirm `image.webp` and `og.png` are present in `src/content/reviews/en/dell-alienware-aw3225qf/` and `npm run build` passes.
