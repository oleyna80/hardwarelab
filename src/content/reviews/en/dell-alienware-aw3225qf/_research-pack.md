    Just picked up the AW3225QF a few days ago and it’s been amazing so far. Tried CP2077, Helldivers 2, and Space Marine 2 on my PC (4070 Super), all look incredible. Hooked up my PS5 as well and played Spider-Man Remastered + TLOU Part 1 Remastered, and the image quality is super crisp and a blast to play. I came from a 34” 3440x1440 VA ultrawide, so this feels like a big upgrade in clarity and overall experience.

    I ordered mine on release day. Due to my traveling for work, it's been in storage for about half the time, but I've used it quite a lot, and I absolutely love it. I have the ROG 32" OLED gaming monitor, and the Alienware one is, to me, way better. It's easier on my eyes, and it's beautiful.

    To be clear, using Dolby Vision Bright does not properly fix the issues with the Peak 1000 mode. Instead of dimming things, you’re overbrightening things. Other manufacturers have implemented similar brightness boosting modes, like the Gigabyte one you mentioned.

    Yes it actually performed pretty well out of the box given the cosmetic issues. Although, my 4090 was having issues pushing above 170 fps in Cyberpunk. I figure 50 FPS isn’t worth the price increase over the LG C3 so I refunded it. I noticed it was a bit less immersive as well.
