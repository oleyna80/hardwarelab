# Research Pack: Gigabyte AORUS FO32U2P (32" 4K QD-OLED, 240Hz)

## 1. Product Identity (US)
- **Title (Amazon US):** GIGABYTE - AORUS FO32U2 Pro - 32" QD OLED Gaming Monitor
- **ASIN (US):** B0D51672JM
- **URL:** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D51672JM
- **Variant Match:** Listing title says “FO32U2 Pro”, but the listing text references **FO32U2P** and shows `Series`/`Item model number` as **AORUS FO32U2P SA**; it also claims DP 2.1 UHBR20 + display daisy chain support (verify on-page before writing).

## 2. ASINs by Region
- **DE:** B0CYQG1LZX (https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CYQG1LZX)
- **FR:** B0CYQG1LZX (https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CYQG1LZX)
- **CRITICAL WARNING (P vs Non-P):** In EU marketplaces, listings are often grouped. **Verify the product name in-cart includes the suffix “FO32U2P”**. The Non-P model (FO32U2) lacks UHBR20 and Daisy Chain.

## 3. Editorial Fields

## 5. ReviewHero keySpecs (3-5 items)
- **DP 2.1 UHBR20 (80Gbps)** - Higher bandwidth; “DSC-free” claims depend on GPU + timings.
- **QD-OLED (Samsung Display 3rd gen)** - Updated subpixel structure; strong color volume.
- **USB-C DP Alt Mode + up to 65W PD + KVM** - One-cable laptop setup (with USB hub).
- **DP 1.4 daisy chain output** - Multi-monitor chaining support (verify workflow limitations).
- **Tactical Switch** - Physical button for rapid resolution changes (e.g., 24" mode).

## 8. NOT FOUND / Ambiguities
- **Included cables:** TFTCentral reports an “Ultra High Speed HDMI 2.1 cable provided”, but DP cable type/certification (DP80 etc) is **NOT FOUND** in accessible sources.
- **DSC / disabling DSC:** TFTCentral reports no OSD setting to disable DSC; practical “DSC-free” use depends on future DP 2.1 GPU support and supported timings.
