# Editor Report: lg-39gx90sa-w-oled-monitor

## Summary
The review content is solid and accurately reflects the research pack. Structure adheres to the Master Prompt. I've performed light editing to improve readability and ensure strict compliance with Hard Gates.

## Changes Applied
- **Headings**: Renamed "Smart Features vs. Monitor Functionality" to "**Do Smart Features Justify the Trade-offs?**" to meet the "Minimum 2 Question-Based Headings" requirement.
- **Aesthetics**: Bolded key specifications and features in the body text (e.g., **39 inches**, **800R curve**, **240Hz**, **webOS 24**) to improve scannability.
- **Verification**: Confirmed all specifications match `_research-pack.md` (specifically 0.266mm pixel pitch and USB 2.0 limitation).
- **Links**: Verified all internal links against the authorized list.
- **User Feedback**: Confirmed 4 verbatim quotes with correct attribution.

## Needs Verification
- None.

## Notes for QA
- Ready for Art Director (Visual Assets) and final build check.
