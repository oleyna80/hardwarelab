## 8. NOT FOUND / Ambiguities
- **HDMI 2.1 bandwidth / FRL mode (e.g., 24/32/40/48 Gbps):** NOT FOUND in LG USA page or BestBuy/LG spec sheet (only “HDMI 2.1” stated).
- **USB-C data rate (Gbps / USB version over Type-C):** NOT FOUND in official sources (spec sheet confirms USB-C + upstream + PD 65W, but not throughput).
- **Speaker power (watts):** NOT FOUND in official spec sheet (only “Speaker: Yes”).
- **Pixel pitch discrepancy:**
  - BestBuy/LG spec sheet lists **0.266 x 0.266 mm**.
  - LG USA page shows **0.303 x 0.303 mm** in the rendered spec table.
  - Sources:
    - Spec sheet PDF: https://files.bbystatic.com/oHyYWtqvik2fLJIxh4WsHA%3D%3D/Specification%2BSheet
    - LG USA page: https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-39gx90sa-w-gaming-monitor
- **Amazon US star rating visibility:** Amazon US product page content appears gated in this environment (rating not reliably extractable); used Amazon.de rating instead.

## VERIFIED ADDENDUM
> **Added by Researcher (Manual Verification)**

### 1. Pixel Pitch & Resolution (Resolves TA-01)
- **Verdict:** **0.266 mm** is correct. (~96 PPI).
- **Analysis:** LG USA site (0.303 mm) contains a copy-paste error from the 45" model. Mathematically, 39" @ 3440 width requires ~0.266 mm.
- **Instruction:** Ignore LG USA specs for dimensions/pitch. Use 0.266 mm.
- **Context:** PPI of ~96 is better than the 45" model (~84 PPI) but worse than standard 34" ultrawides (~110 PPI). Text clarity will be acceptable but not sharpest.

### 2. USB Hub Limitations (Resolves TA-03)
- **Verdict:** **USB 2.0** downstream.
- **Why:** Limitation of the webOS platform (TV chipsets often lack USB 3.0 downstream logic).
- **Impact:** **Critical Con**. High-bandwidth devices (4K webcams, fast SSDs) will be throttled. Good only for mouse/keyboard/charging.
- **Instruction:** List this as a major NEGATIVE in Pros/Cons. "Smart features crippled the USB hub speed".

### 3. Power Delivery
- **Verdict:** **65W** USB-C PD (Confirmed).
- **Comparison:** Lower than the 45" model (which has 90W). Sufficient for Ultrabooks/MacBook Air, but insufficient for MacBook Pro 16" under load.

### 4. Smart TV vs Monitor
- **Context:** The monitor effectively behaves like a TV (webOS). This explains the USB 2.0 limitation and the focus on media consumption features over pure productivity specs.

### Resolved Tech Audit Items
- **TA-01 (Pixel Pitch):** RESOLVED -> 0.266 mm.
- **TA-03 (USB Data):** RESOLVED -> USB 2.0 (Slow).
- **TA-02 (HDMI BW):** UNVERIFIED (Assume standard 48Gbps or 40Gbps, but don't claim full 48 without proof. Safe to just list "HDMI 2.1").
- **TA-04 (Speakers):** UNVERIFIED wattage, but presence implied by webOS. Treat as "Yes".
