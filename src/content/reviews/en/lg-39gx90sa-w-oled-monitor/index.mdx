## LG 39GX90SA-W at a glance
The LG 39GX90SA-W sits in a unique spot between the common 34-inch ultrawides and the massive 45-inch giants. At **39 inches**, it offers more immersion without demanding the massive desk space of its larger sibling. It retains the aggressive **800R curve** and **240Hz OLED** panel performance but adds LG's **webOS smart platform**, effectively turning this gaming monitor into a smart TV hybrid.

## The 39-Inch Sweet Spot?
For many gamers, 34 inches feels slightly too small for a truly cinematic wrap-around effect, while 45 inches can feel overwhelming (and suffers from lower pixel density). The 39GX90SA-W strikes a balance. With a **pixel density of ~96 PPI**, it's sharper than the 45-inch version (~84 PPI) though still softer than a standard 34-inch 1440p panel (~110 PPI). The **800R curvature** is the defining feature here—it brings the corners of the screen significantly closer to your eyes, creating an unparalleled sense of presence in first-person shooters and racing sims.

## Do Smart Features Justify the Trade-offs?
The inclusion of **webOS 24** is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you get native access to Netflix, YouTube, and GeForce Now without turning on your PC, along with a remote control. On the other hand, the hardware underlying these smart features imposes some limitations most PC users won't like. Most notably, the **USB hub is limited to USB 2.0 speeds**, which is a bottleneck for high-speed peripherals like external SSDs or 4K webcams.

## Gaming Performance
This is where the 39GX90SA-W shines. The **240Hz refresh rate** paired with OLED's near-instant **0.03ms response time** delivers motion clarity that LCDs simply can't match. G-Sync compatibility and FreeSync Premium ensure tear-free gaming. The HDR performance is stellar, with **VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400** certification and peaks up to 1300 nits (at 1.5% window), making highlights pop against perfect OLED blacks.

## Verdict
The LG 39GX90SA-W is a formidable choice for gamers who find 34 inches too small and 45 inches too big (or too blurry). It offers a unique form factor that maximizes immersion without sacrificing too much sharpness. However, the decision to limit the USB hub to 2.0 speeds to accommodate smart TV features is a disappointing compromise for a high-end monitor. It's an excellent *gaming* display and a capable media center, but heavy productivity users might struggle with the aggressive curve and lack of high-speed connectivity.
