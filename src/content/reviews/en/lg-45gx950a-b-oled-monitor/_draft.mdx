## LG 45GX950A-B at a glance
The LG 45GX950A-B is a bold attempt to solve the "productivity vs. gaming" dilemma for ultrawide enthusiasts. By pushing the resolution to 5120 x 2160 (5K2K), it offers significantly higher pixel density (~125 PPI) than standard 45-inch 1440p OLEDs, addressing one of the biggest complaints about large-format WOLED panels. It doesn't stop there; LG has integrated its "Dual-Mode" technology, allowing competitive gamers to switch to a blisteringly fast 330Hz refresh rate at a lower resolution.

## Is 5K2K the Sweet Spot for Ultrawides?
For years, 45-inch OLEDs were held back by 3440 x 1440 resolution, which resulted in mediocre text clarity. The 45GX950A-B's massive jump to 5120 x 2160 changes the equation. Games look sharper, and more importantly, text and UI elements are much crisper for productivity work. While it's not quite "Retina" quality, it's a noticeable upgrade that makes this monitor a viable single-screen solution for both work and play.

## Does Dual-Mode Justify the Price?
The "Dual-Mode" feature is LG's ace in the hole. With a few clicks, the monitor transforms from a high-resolution 165Hz immersive display into a 330Hz 1080p speed demon. This versatility means you don't have to choose between graphical fidelity and competitive responsiveness. Combined with the deep blacks and near-instant response times of OLED, it handles everything from cinematic RPGs to twitchy shooters with ease.

## Panel Performance & Design
The 800R curve is aggressive—fantastic for immersion in gaming but requiring an adjustment period for desktop use. Ergonomically, the stand takes up significant depth, so a deep desk is recommended. The matte coating effectively mitigates glare, a common issue with glossy OLEDs, though it softens the image slightly. With VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification, the monitor delivers the infinite contrast expected of OLED, making HDR content pop, even if peak brightness trails Mini-LED competitors.

    comment: "I just had to come to terms with the fact that the LG 45GX950A-B isn't for me. The text clarity is improved with some calibration to ClearType, but it can't fix the pixel pitch and I can really tell that my reading efficiency is really down on this thing."

    comment: "When I first power on the display there is a very annoying high pitched coil whine noise. There is audible fan noise when there is no other noise drowning it out. It's audible from a few meters and sound like cheap fan bearing."

    comment: "Text clarity is great. Must have been the display unit. It was possibly running in dual mode (lower resolution and high refresh rate) or not set correctly at OS level."

## Verdict
The LG 45GX950A-B is a powerhouse that bridges the gap between high-end productivity and elite gaming. If you can stomach the aggressive curve and the price, the combination of 5K2K resolution and Dual-Mode refresh rate makes it one of the most versatile monitors on the market. It's not perfect—fan noise is a concern for silent PC builds—but for a do-it-all battlestation, it's hard to beat.
