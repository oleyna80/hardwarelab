# Editor Report: lg-45gx950a-b-oled-monitor

## Summary
The review is in excellent shape. Content aligns perfectly with the Research Pack, and the structure follows the Master Prompt guidelines strictly. I have applied minor aesthetic edits (bolding key terms) to improve scannability. All hard gates (question headings, verbatim quotes, internal links) are passed.

## Changes Applied
- **Aesthetics**: Added bolding to key features in the body text (5K2K resolution, Dual-Mode, 330Hz, 800R curve, VESA DisplayHDR) to improve readability.
- **Verification**: Confirmed all specifications match `_research-pack.md`.
- **Links**: Verified all "Related Reviews" links against `prompts/existing-reviews-hardwarelab.md`.
- **Gates**: Confirmed minimum 2 question-based headings and 4 verbatim user quotes.

## Needs Verification
- None.

## Notes for QA
- Review is ready for visual assets (Art Director) and final build check.
