  * quote: "Games look amazing. I mainly play World of Warcraft and the aspect ratio/extra height compared to a 1440p screen is just as nice as the extra height given by my old 1600p... I really like the curve and I think it's required for a screen of this size."

  * quote: "If you're looking directly head on, you really don't notice the curve. If you're at an off-angle, it does become pronounced... It really is super nice for gaming. It's bright enough in a dark room to pop and the matte coating does in fact help with even ambient / desk lights."

  * quote: "I just had to come to terms with the fact that the LG 45GX950A-B isn't for me. The text clarity is improved with some calibration to ClearType, but it can't fix the pixel pitch and while it is way better than when I first plugged it in, I can really tell that my reading efficiency is really down on this thing."

  * quote: "When I first power on the display there is a very annoying high pitched coil whine noise... There is audible fan noise when there is no other noise drowning it out... It's audible from a few meters and sound like cheap fan bearing."

  * quote: "Text clarity is great. Must have been the display unit. It was possibly running in dual mode (lower resolution and high refresh rate) or not set correctly at OS level."
