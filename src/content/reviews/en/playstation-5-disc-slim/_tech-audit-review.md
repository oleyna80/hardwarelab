## 🛡️ TECH AUDIT REPORT
**Status:** GREEN: Ready to Write

### 1. Technical "Gotchas" (Critical Nuances)
* **Vertical Stand Omission:** The Slim model does **NOT** include the vertical stand (unlike the OG PS5). It only comes with flimsy plastic "feet" for horizontal use. This is a critical "hidden cost" to mention.
* **Disc Drive Registration:** Remind readers that the detachable disc drive requires a one-time internet connection to pair (even for the bundled Disc Edition).
* **Port Spec:** Correctly noted 2x USB-C front. Be clear that the top one is USB 2.0 (Hi-Speed) and bottom is 10Gbps. This trips people up charging controllers vs data.

### 2. The "Angle" (Writing Strategy)
* **Target Persona:** The "Late Adopter" or "Physical Media Holdout". Someone who skipped the massive OG PS5 or is upgrading from a loud PS4 Pro.
* **The Hook:** "It's the PS5 you know, just 30% smaller and slightly louder." 
* **Mandatory Cons:** 
    * Vertical stand sold separately ($30).
    * Fan noise pitch (often higher frequency than OG).
    * Cheap horizontal "feet".

### 3. Verification Items (If RED)
* *None - Research Pack is solid.*

### 4. Content Notes
* **Usernames:** One Reddit username is... expressive (`captaincumsock69`). Use the quote content as it's valuable (noise reduction by moving it), but maybe abbreviate the user to `captain...` or `Reddit User` if the timeline allows, or just let it fly if "Integrator" tone accepts raw internet culture.
* **Related Reviews:** Good selection.
