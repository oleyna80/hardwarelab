# Editor Report

**Status:** EDITS APPLIED

## Summary
The review was well-written but missed two structural gates: the minimum number of question-based headings and the minimum number of user feedback quotes.

## Changes Applied
- **Heading Update:** Changed `## The 5V/5A Power Headache` to `## Why Is The 5V/5A Power Requirement A Problem?` to satisfy the "Minimum 2 Question Headings" rule.
- **User Feedback:** Added a 4th quote from `alasdairallan` (found in Research Pack) to satisfy the "4-6 Quotes" rule.
- **General Scan:** No typos or "fluff" detected. Tone is consistent with guidelines.

## Needs Verification
- *None.*

## Notes for QA
- `AffiliateButton` and imports look correct.
