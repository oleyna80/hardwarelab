  * quote: "50-60C is downright cool for almost any CPU. We don't need to be talking about overheating until you're seeing 90C+ If your power supply isn't supplying enough power the chip could be throttling because of that. I would get one that's guaranteed to work like the official one or a trusted third party."

  * quote: "The official active cooler is low cost but I think 3rd party cases that include cooling are a better value. You can get passive cases for no noise or cases with active cooling if you’re doing something heavy duty."

  * quote: "Saw the reviews up today for the Raspberry Pi 5 and I was very disappointed. 1) it still uses microsd as boot when the Orange Pi 5 uses nvme as boot. I had constant problems with my media server in raspberry pi 5 with corrupt sd card as boot and want to use nvme as boot."

  * quote: "That's absolutely fine. There is nothing wrong with getting into the 60C, no harm will come to your Pi. It'll thermally throttle the CPU at 85C, but even that is absolutely fine and that's what it's designed to do, nothing to worry about."
