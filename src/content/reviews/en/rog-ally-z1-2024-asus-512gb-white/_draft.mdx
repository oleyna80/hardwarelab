## ASUS ROG Ally Z1 at a glance

The **ASUS ROG Ally Z1** (RC71L) enters the handheld arena as a more affordable sibling to the Z1 Extreme model, targeting gamers who want the versatility of Windows 11 without the premium price tag. While often listed with "2024" in retail titles due to ongoing sales popularity, it is important to note that this unit uses the original 2023 chassis design, distinct from the newer ROG Ally X refresh.

At its core lies the AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, a custom Zen 4 chip designed specifically for handhelds. It pairs 6 cores and 12 threads with RDNA 3 graphics to deliver solid 720p/1080p performance in a lightweight 608g package. The star of the show remains the 7-inch 1080p 120Hz touchscreen, featuring FreeSync Premium to smooth out gameplay even when framerates dip.

## Who is the Z1 "Non-Extreme" For?

The "vanilla" Z1 invites a direct comparison to the Steam Deck and its own Z1 Extreme big brother. With 4 RDNA 3 compute units (vs 12 in the Extreme), raw graphical horsepower is pared back, but cpu performance remains robust for emulation and CPU-bound indie titles.

For users primarily focused on lighter indie games, 2D platformers, and older AAA titles, the Z1 offers a compelling experience. The 1080p screen is noticeably sharper than competitors' 800p displays, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes navigating Windows and playing lighter games feel incredibly responsive.

## Performance & Gaming Experience

Unlike the walled garden of main consoles, the ROG Ally runs full Windows 11 Home. This means instant access to **Xbox Game Pass**, Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and more without workarounds.

  features={[
    "AMD RSR (Radeon Super Resolution)",
    "AMD RIS (Radeon Image Sharpening)",
    "Silent, Performance, and Turbo Modes"
  ]}

In tests, the Z1 handles optimization well. Games like *Minecraft* and *Kingdom Hearts* shine on the high-refresh display. More demanding titles like *Cyberpunk 2077* or *Elden Ring* require dialing settings down to Low and utilizing FSR upscaling to maintain playable framerates, often targeting 720p output which scales cleanly to the native screen.

### Ergonomics and Design

Weighing in at just 608 grams, the ROG Ally is lighter than many of its peers, reducing wrist fatigue during extended sessions. The textured grips and ergonomic slant make it comfortable for various hand sizes. The inclusion of two back buttons allows for macro mapping, essential for shooters or complex RPGs.

## Important Note on Storage and Reliability

Early units of the ROG Ally (RC71L chassis) faced reports regarding SD card reader reliability under high thermal loads. While ASUS has extended warranties to 24 months in many regions and introduced revised motherboards in mid-2024, users should be aware of this potential limitation.

We recommend relying primarily on the fast internal NVMe SSD for demanding AAA games to minimize heat near the reader slot, using MicroSD cards for less intensive media or backups.

## Verdict

The **ASUS ROG Ally Z1** succeeds as an entry point into legitimate Windows handheld gaming. It sacrifices the raw grunt of the Extreme model but retains the best features: the magnificent screen, the ergonomics, and the software compatibility. For users whose library leans towards indie hits, emulation, or optimized eSports titles, it offers a premium experience at a mid-range price.

However, power users looking to push modern AAA titles at higher settings should consider the Z1 Extreme or look at dedicated home consoles for guaranteed performance.
