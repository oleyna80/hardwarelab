## VERIFIED ADDENDUM (Tech Audit Close-out)

### TA-01 → RESOLVED
**Claim:** "2024" in the title/slug is misleading — the Z1 White is the 2023 model (RC71L), not the 2024 Ally X (RC72LA).

**Verified Sources:**
- ASUS Official Spec Page: https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-2023/spec/
  - Page clearly states: "ROG Ally Gaming Console (2023) RC71L" with model numbers RC71L-ALLY.Z1_512 (Z1) and RC71L-ALLY.Z1X_512 (Z1 Extreme)
- Wikipedia ROG Ally article: confirms RC71L = original 2023 model; RC72LA = 2024 Ally X

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED. The Amazon ASIN B0C8H1FHFH is the **2023 original chassis (RC71L)** with Z1 processor. The "2024" in Amazon titles is SEO spam (units sold in 2024), NOT the Ally X refresh.

**Action for Copywriter:**
- Title/meta should **avoid "2024"** to prevent confusion with Ally X
- May clarify in review body: "This is the original ROG Ally (RC71L, 2023 chassis) — not to be confused with the 2024 Ally X (RC72LA)"

---

### TA-02 → RESOLVED (issue confirmed, add caution)
**Claim:** SD card reader has a known thermal defect in RC71L units causing failures.

**Verified Sources:**
- ASUS Official Forum (May 2024): https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?135125-ROG-Ally-TF-SD-Card-and-Reliability — ASUS acknowledged and extended warranty to 24 months
- Multiple tech reports (RetroResolve, EaseUS, Windows Central) confirm heat from VRMs near the SD slot causing reader failure and SD card damage
- ASUS announced revised motherboard (June 2024) expected Aug–Sep 2024

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED. Hardware defect is real and documented. ASUS extended warranty + announced board revision.

**Action for Copywriter:**
- In Drawbacks section: note the SD card reader reliability concern for early units
- Optionally mention: "ASUS extended warranty to 24 months and released a revised board (mid-2024) — check with seller for unit manufacturing date"

**Status on "batch fix" question from Tech Audit:**
- UNVERIFIED: No official ASUS statement was found confirming that ASIN B0C8H1FHFH ships with the revised motherboard. Recommend disclaimer: "earlier batches may have the known SD card reader thermal issue".
