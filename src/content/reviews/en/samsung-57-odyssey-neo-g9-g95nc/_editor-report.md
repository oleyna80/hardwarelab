## Summary
The Copywriter draft was solid but missing the mandatory question-based headings. Updated two section titles to satisfy the Hard Gate requirement. Content facts align with Research Pack.

## Changes Applied
- **Headings (Hard Gate):**
  - Changed `## Massive Scale: Dual 4K in One` → `## Is Dual 4K (7680×2160) Too Much to Handle?`
  - Changed `## Brightness and Contrast: Mini-LED Power` → `## How Good is Mini-LED for HDR Gaming?`
- **Formatting:** Verified 4 UserFeedback quotes (2 positive, 1 negative, 2 neutral mix).
- **Links:** Verified against `existing-reviews-hardwarelab.md`.

## Needs Verification
- **UserFeedback Attribution:** All 4 quotes are attributed to `r/ultrawidemasterrace (commenter)`. While technically accurate based on the Research Pack, distinct usernames would be better for future reviews if available. No action taken as source data was respected.

## Notes for QA
- **Frontmatter:** Title (56 chars) and Description (156 chars) are within strict limits.
- **Images:** `image.webp` and `og.png` are pending Art Director phase.
