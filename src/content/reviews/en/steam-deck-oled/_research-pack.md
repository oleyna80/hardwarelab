  * quote: "My only thing about the ally is the battery life. I know I don't have as much time to game, but a handheld should still have as much battery life as possible. The OLED battery life is perfect so far. It plays roms for hours, it can play Fallout 4 for a good session, and it can play Shadow of War for a good time to."

  * quote: "It's all personal preference - some people don't really notice a difference at all - but personally, the OG Steam Deck had a terrible display. Granted, before the OLED was announced, it was one of the only feasible ways to play Steam games natively on a handheld, so I didn't care, and was happy with it. But I swapped it for an OLED immediately and it's a night and day difference. I say, under no circumstances should you buy an LCD model now that the OLED model is an option, unless the price difference is a make-or-break for you."

  * quote: "Can't believe no one has mentioned the refresh rate. The OLED is worth it for the 90Hz screen and bigger battery (plus more efficient mode) alone. You'll get a least an extra hour on battery and input latency is dramatically reduced. Also the OLED screen has a faster response time."

  * quote: "Also for what it’s worth, I have several OLED devices, and the steam deck LCD screen looks great to me, never had a problem with it, it’s colorful and bright, it looks good to me. Never experienced strain either, The OLED and the LCD is the same chipset, plays the same games, use whatever one you enjoy, it’s the same system. In fact, the steam deck is pretty underpowered compared to what the rivals are now offering, You can’t play new AAA games, you are limited to indie games, and older AA games, And if you can run AAA games they are a stuttery 30 FPS. It’s far from a perfect device. lol"

### NOT FOUND / Ambiguities
* ASIN_US is intentionally set to absent because no amazon.com listing for the same canonical card was proven; observed US 1TB OLED listings appear as separate reseller ASINs.
* Direct page fetches for Amazon FR/DE/UK/IT/ES can intermittently fail in automated tooling (HTTP/anti-bot), so regional variant checks above preserve the previously established title/ASIN evidence for the same 1TB OLED variant.
* Amazon marketplace brand label may appear as “Valve Index” on some regional pages; model/title/details still identify Steam Deck OLED 1TB (Valve-1TB-OLED).
