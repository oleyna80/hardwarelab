## Synology DS423+ at a glance

The **Synology DS423+** is a 4-bay NAS built around an Intel Celeron platform, which makes it a standout in Synology's lineup for one reason: **Plex hardware transcoding**. If you want a quiet, appliance-like NAS that can do backups, a family photo cloud, and occasional containers—without becoming a weekend project—this model is designed for you.

## Key specs and platform overview

<SpecGrid specs={{
  "CPU": "Intel Celeron J4125 (4-core, 2.0–2.7GHz)",
  "Memory": "2GB DDR4 non-ECC (1 slot, up to 6GB total)",
  "Drive bays": "4x 3.5\"/2.5\" SATA (hot-swap)",
  "NVMe slots": "2x M.2 2280 NVMe (cache or storage pool with verified SSDs)",
  "Networking": "2x 1GbE RJ-45 (link aggregation supported)",
  "Ports": "2x USB 3.2 Gen 1"
}} />

## Who should buy it?

This NAS is a good fit for:

- **Home media** with Plex or Jellyfin where hardware transcoding matters
- **Family backups** (PC/Mac backups, phone photo sync, Time Machine)
- **Small-office file sharing** that benefits from DSM apps and Btrfs snapshots
- **Light Docker** (downloaders, Home Assistant, small services)

If you’re planning heavier virtualization, multi-gig networking, or a long list of containers, the better fit is usually the **[Synology DS923+](/reviews/synology-ds923)** or a more upgrade-friendly competitor like the **[QNAP TS-464](/reviews/qnap-ts-464)**.

## Plex usage: what “hardware transcoding” really changes

For many Plex libraries, Intel Quick Sync can offload video transcoding. That said, whether you *need* transcoding depends on your clients:

- If your playback devices can **Direct Play** (Apple TV, Nvidia Shield, modern TVs), the NAS mostly serves files.
- If your clients often need **codec conversion** (for example, HEVC to H.264), hardware transcoding can be the difference between “works” and “buffers.”

Note that Plex hardware transcoding typically requires **Plex Pass**, and your real-world results depend on codec, bitrate, and how many simultaneous streams you run.

## Networking: will 1GbE be a bottleneck?

This model sticks to **dual 1GbE**, and that’s the biggest practical limitation.

- For **one user**, gigabit is usually fine for backups and media streaming.
- For **multiple editors** moving large files (or multiple 4K remux streams), 1GbE can become the ceiling.

Link aggregation can help with multiple clients, but it won’t turn a single workstation transfer into multi-gig speeds. If multi-gig is your baseline requirement, consider alternatives with 2.5GbE or 10GbE networking.

## DSM software: the real reason people buy Synology

Hardware matters, but **DSM is the product**. You get the core Synology experience:

- **Synology Photos** for a private family gallery
- **Hyper Backup** for versioned backups to USB, another NAS, or cloud
- **Snapshot Replication** (with Btrfs) for fast rollback and ransomware recovery patterns
- **Active Backup for Business** for PC/server backup workflows
- **Surveillance Station** if you want a camera NVR later

If you value a cohesive, well-documented NAS OS more than raw specs, this class of DiskStation remains very competitive.

## Upgrade path: RAM and NVMe choices

Out of the box, the system ships with **2GB RAM**, which is sufficient for file serving and a small set of packages. If you want Docker + Photos indexing + Plex together, a RAM bump is often the best quality-of-life upgrade.

The two NVMe slots are most commonly used for **SSD cache**. They can also be used for an NVMe storage pool, but Synology’s guidance favors verified SSDs for that workload.

## DS423+ vs DS923+: the short version

Both are excellent NAS appliances, but they target different priorities:

- **This model**: pick it for Plex hardware transcoding and a straightforward home-media build.
- **DS923+**: pick it for stronger CPU performance, more flexible memory/networking upgrades, and heavier business-style workloads.

If you are on the fence, decide based on whether **transcoding is a must-have** or just a “nice to have.”

## Verdict

If you want a polished NAS that can be your **backup hub + private cloud + Plex box**, the Synology DS423+ remains one of the most balanced choices in the 4-bay class—especially for media libraries that benefit from Intel hardware transcoding. The trade-off is clear: you’re buying into the DSM ecosystem and Quick Sync advantages, while accepting **1GbE networking** and a modest default RAM configuration.
