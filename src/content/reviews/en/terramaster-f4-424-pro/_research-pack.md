  * quote: "Unraid runs off of the USB and apps e.g. appdata, domains, system, should be kept on the M.2's. Yep. Argument can be made that your VMs run on cache as well but it depends on how big the disks are and how big the VMs are."

  * quote: "I'm using the 424 Pro, got unraid running on it without a problem. There isn't enough clearance to remove the old USB drive that comes with it that has their OS on it, unless you remove two screws from the back (so i couldn't go back to their OS). All in all, it was painless."

  * quote: "You wouldn’t really want a VM inside a VM. You’d be better off running Proxmox bare metal and then virtualise your NAS OS and pass the drives through. I’ve got the F4-424 Pro but use UnRaid on it."

### NOT FOUND / Ambiguities
* Amazon US page access is partially gated (rating/reviews not reliably retrievable in this environment), so rating was taken from the accessible Amazon DE listing.
* Regional ASIN mismatch: US uses B0CPPD51B9, while DE/FR use B0CQY9L8GP for the same i3-N305 + 32GB DDR5 class configuration; treat translations carefully.
* No official PDF manual/spec sheet located; rely on manufacturer web spec table for ports/dimensions/CPU claims.
* Related Reviews were sourced from the provided existing list.
