  * quote: "Next to my Synology now sits a Great, Mighty NASync DXP4800 Plus, looking down on my puny old two-bay DiskStation. With about 400% better specs in every way (CPU cores, speed, memory, storage capacity) and software that is lifetimes ahead of Synology. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the UGOS is actually just Debian 12, and that it is possible to install apt packages."
