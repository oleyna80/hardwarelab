## UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus at a glance

The **UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus** is a disruptor in the 4-bay NAS market, offering hardware specs that traditional competitors like Synology or QNAP often reserve for much higher price brackets or require expensive add-ons to match. With an **Intel Pentium Gold 8505** CPU, **8GB of DDR5 RAM**, and built-in **10GbE**, it targets power users who want maximum performance and media capabilities without purchasing separate upgrade modules.

## Hardware Supremacy: 10GbE and Pentium Gold

The standout feature of the DXP4800 Plus is its connectivity and processing power. While most 4-bay NAS units in this class stick to 1GbE or 2.5GbE, UGREEN includes a **10GbE port** right out of the box. This makes it an incredible value for creative professionals or homelabbers who need to move large files quickly over a local network.

The **Intel Pentium Gold 8505** is a significant step up from the Celeron processors typically found in this segment. With 5 cores (1 Performance core, 4 Efficient cores) and 6 threads, it provides ample headroom for running multiple Docker containers, virtual machines, and background tasks without breaking a sweat.

## Plex Powerhouse: Intel QuickSync

Unlike the AMD Ryzen-based Synology DS923+, the **UGREEN DXP4800 Plus** features Intel UHD Graphics with **QuickSync support**. This is a game-changer for Plex and Jellyfin users. It can handle multiple hardware transcodes simultaneously, making it a more capable choice for a media server if your clients require transcoding.

## Software: UGOS Pro vs. The Titans

The hardware is excellent, but the software is where UGREEN is still playing catch-up. **UGOS Pro** is based on Debian 12 (according to community findings), which appeals to Linux enthusiasts because it allows for standard `apt` package management and a familiar environment. However, it lacks the decade-plus of polish, app ecosystem, and "it just works" reliability of Synology's DSM.

For users comfortable with Docker and potentially tinkering with the OS, this is an advantage. For those who want a set-it-and-forget-it appliance, the software experience may feel less refined compared to established competitors.

    comment: "This NAS has one particular feature I really like! 2 Network Cards - 2.5 and 10Gb. It has a lot of other bells and whistles like a a nice Pentium gold 8505 with 5 cores and 6 threads and expandable RAM slots up to 64GB. But for me it was the network design that got me!",

    comment: "Next to my Synology now sits a Great, Mighty NASync DXP4800 Plus, looking down on my puny old two-bay DiskStation. With about 400% better specs in every way (CPU cores, speed, memory, storage capacity) and software that is lifetimes ahead of Synology. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the UGOS is actually just Debian 12, and that it is possible to install apt packages.",
