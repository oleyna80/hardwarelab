        <p>
            HardwareLab is a participant in the <strong
                >Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong
            >, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for
            sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to <a

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            When you click on an affiliate link on our site and make a purchase,
            we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. This
            helps support our independent review work and allows us to continue
            providing free, unbiased hardware reviews.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Integrity Promise</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> Affiliate relationships never
                influence our reviews, ratings, or recommendations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We test products ourselves and report
                our genuine findings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transparency:</strong> All affiliate links are clearly marked
                with appropriate disclosure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Pay-for-Play:</strong> We do not accept payment in exchange
                for positive reviews.
            </li>
        </ul>
